# Pokemon ROM Files

This directory contains helper scripts for generating minimal valid ROM structures that work with the EmulatorJS system. 

## How it works

- When you select a game from the emulator interface, it dynamically generates a minimal valid ROM structure
- The ROM structure includes proper headers and basic data needed for each system
- No actual game code is included - just enough structure to make the emulator load properly
- Users are prompted to upload their own ROMs for the full experience

## Files in this directory

- `stub-rom-content.js` - Creates valid ROM structures for various systems
- `rom-generator.js` - Utility for generating downloadable ROM files
- Pokemon placeholders - Used as fallbacks if dynamic generation fails

## Technical Details

The dynamic ROM generation system:
1. Creates ROM files with correct headers for each system (GB, GBC, GBA, NDS, etc.)
2. Includes system-specific validation bytes (like Nintendo logo data)
3. Creates minimal runnable code that displays instructions to the user
4. Does not contain any copyrighted game data

## Legal Considerations

Using this emulator to play games you don't own may be a copyright violation in some jurisdictions. Please ensure you own a legitimate copy of any games you play through this emulator.

The emulator itself is legal software, but the ROMs (game files) are subject to copyright laws.

## ROM Sources

1. Dumping your own cartridges with appropriate hardware
2. Downloading from legitimate sources where you own the original game
3. Using public domain or freely available ROMs
