# Pokemon ROM Files

This directory previously contained placeholder files for Pokemon ROM demonstrations.

The emulator has been updated to directly load ROM files from emulatorgames.net, which provides direct access to many game ROMs including Pokemon titles.

## How it works

- When you select a game from the emulator interface, it will attempt to load the ROM directly from emulatorgames.net
- No ROM files are actually stored in this directory - everything is streamed directly
- If the ROM fails to load for any reason, you'll be given the option to visit the game's page on emulatorgames.net

## Legal Considerations

Using this emulator to play games you don't own may be a copyright violation in some jurisdictions. Please ensure you own a legitimate copy of any games you play through this emulator.

The emulator itself is legal software, but the ROMs (game files) are subject to copyright laws.
